Install and Configure the CloudWatch Agent on the EC2 Instance
The AWS CloudWatch Agent needs to be installed on your EC2 instance to monitor metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.

1.1 Install CloudWatch Agent
* SSH into your EC2 instance:
        # ssh -i terraform.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
* Install the CloudWatch Agent:
       # sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent
1.2 Configure the CloudWatch Agent
* Create a CloudWatch Agent configuration file. You can use the following configuration to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage:
      # sudo vi /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json

{
  "agent": {
    "metrics_collection_interval": 60,
    "logfile": "/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "append_dimensions": {
      "InstanceId": "${aws:InstanceId}"
    },
    "metrics_collected": {
      "cpu": {
        "measurement": [
          "cpu_usage_idle",
          "cpu_usage_iowait",
          "cpu_usage_user",
          "cpu_usage_system"
        ],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60,
        "totalcpu": true
      },
      "disk": {
        "measurement": [
          "used_percent"
        ],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60,
        "resources": [
          "/"
        ]
      },
      "mem": {
        "measurement": [
          "mem_used_percent"
        ],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60
      }
    }
  }
}

2. Start the CloudWatch Agent:
2. Set Up CloudWatch Alarm for CPU Usage
Now, configure a CloudWatch Alarm to notify you when CPU usage exceeds 80%.

2.1 Create a CloudWatch Alarm
Go to the CloudWatch Console: Open the AWS CloudWatch console.

Create an Alarm:

Navigate to Alarms > Create Alarm.
Select Metric: Choose EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics > CPUUtilization.
Select the Instance: Choose the EC2 instance you want to monitor.
Define Threshold: Set the condition to trigger the alarm when CPU usage exceeds 80%.
Period: Set the evaluation period (e.g., 5 minutes).
Data Points: Set how many consecutive periods must exceed the threshold to trigger the alarm (e.g., 2 out of 3 periods).
Configure Actions:

Notification: Choose Create new topic or select an existing SNS topic.
Email Notifications: Enter your email address to receive alerts.
Name the Alarm: Give it a descriptive name, e.g., High-CPU-Usage.

Review and Create: Review the settings and create the alarm.

2.2 Confirm Email Subscription
If you created a new SNS topic, youâ€™ll receive an email asking you to confirm the subscription. Confirm it to start receiving alerts.

3. Verify Monitoring and Logging
Monitor Metrics: Go back to the CloudWatch console to view the metrics being collected from your EC2 instance.

Metrics: Navigate to Metrics > EC2 to see CPU, memory, and disk usage.
Test the Alarm: You can simulate high CPU usage to test if the alarm triggers and sends an email notification.

# Stress the CPU to trigger the alarm
sudo yum install -y stress
stress --cpu 8 --timeout 600
